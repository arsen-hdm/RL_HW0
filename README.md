# HM0 RL 24/25 Arsen Hudyma

This is the first HM of the course *Robotics Lab*, in the pdf file you can find all the instructions that we had to follow and the results of they.
If you want to test the script that we had to implement you firstly have to clone this repo with the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arsen-hdm/RL_HW0.git
```
When you're in the local repository you just need to run this command:
```bash
./scripthm0.sh
```
or for the other code:
```bash
./hello_world.sh
```

For this HM0 I think that is over, but there's still the other ones so check it! ;)
